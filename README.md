# CSV Output Chataigne Module
Output values into an external CSV file.

## How to use
Create a csv file (this can be blank). 

In Chataigne add the <strong>CSV Output module</strong> (System > CSV Output). In the modulees parameters, under CSV File, browse and select the csv file you created.

Data can be added to the csv as an Action consequence. Each time you add data you create a new value in the csv row. This data is only saved to the file when <strong>Save Row to File</strong> is called.
